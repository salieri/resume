  "caseStudy": {
    "collaborationContent": "Worked in close partnership with the VP of Engineering, who sponsored the initiative as a critical business enabler. The project was self-initiated, proposed, and initially implemented solo before being transitioned to a dedicated team for long-term ownership.",
    "collaborationTitle": "Collaboration",
    "contextContent": "Joined shortly after Series B ($30M), as the company prepared to onboard its first major enterprise customer. Engineering org (~10–15 engineers) had iterated rapidly to reach product-market fit, leaving the core audio-to-notes pipeline fragile, opaque, and increasingly risky to scale.",
    "contextTitle": "Context",
    "outcomesArchitecture": "Architecture <strong>scaled with company growth</strong> and became the foundation for subsequent pipeline work.",
    "outcomesCustomerMigration": "Successfully migrated the first enterprise customer to the new pipeline within ~7 months; completed <strong>full customer migration</strong> incrementally over the next ~2 months to minimize risk.",
    "outcomesMonitoring": "Enabled the ability to build <strong>monitoring and alarms</strong> against telemetry to reduce reaction times to production issues.",
    "outcomesPipelineThroughput": "The pipeline now processes over <strong>100 hours of audio per minute</strong>. It has met the needs of the business through significant growth in customer base and usage volume.",
    "outcomesReliability": "Achieved a step-change improvement in <strong>system reliability, debuggability, and operational visibility</strong>; for the first time, engineers could inspect live workflow state, diagnose failures deterministically, and recover safely.",
    "outcomesTemplates": "Established <strong>reusable project templates</strong> (CI/CD, Helm charts, service layout) that were adopted across the engineering organization.",
    "outcomesTemporalAdoption": "Temporal became a <strong>standard platform primitive</strong> reused well beyond the original pipeline project.",
    "outcomesTitle": "Outcomes",
    "roleScopeContent": "Acted as a horizontal senior technical leader, taking ownership of cross-cutting systems with no natural product owner. Led end-to-end redesign of the core audio-to-notes processing pipeline used by multiple product verticals; served as primary technical decision-maker and on-call escalation point until ownership transitioned to a dedicated team.",

    "title": "Impact Case Study – Abridge"
  },
  "caseStudyContributions": {
    "apiBoundary": "Enforced a single <strong>standardized API boundary</strong> for all pipeline entry points, eliminating divergent implementations and making system behavior observable and predictable.",
    "leadership": "Defined and owned <strong>architecture</strong>, <strong>technical product design</strong>, and <strong>implementation</strong> of the new pipeline from the ground up.",
    "loadTests": "Built and ran <strong>load tests</strong> to validate scaling behavior prior to broad customer migration.",
    "reverseEngineering": "<strong>Reverse-engineered</strong> implicit system behavior from legacy code to establish explicit baseline requirements, then defined forward-looking requirements under uncertain scale and evolving product needs.",
    "templates": "Designed <strong>reusable infrastructure</strong> and <strong>project templates</strong> (CI/CD, Helm charts, service scaffolding) that later became the foundation for other engineering efforts.",
    "testingLintingDocs": "Introduced <strong>end-to-end testing</strong>, strict linting standards, <strong>structured documentation</strong>, flow diagrams where none previously existed.",
    "title": "Contributions",
    "validationSchema": "Implemented <strong>document validation schemas</strong> for all I/O operations (database, APIs, blob storage…) to ensure data integrity."

  "caseStudyDecisions": {
    "kubernetes": "Moved execution from cloud functions to <strong>Kubernetes-based services</strong> to regain debuggability, operational control, and vendor independence.",
    "orchestration": "Architected the new isolated orchestration service using <strong>domain-driven design</strong>, deliberately separating pipeline concerns from product code to reduce blast radius and cognitive load.",
    "reframing": "Reframed the audio-to-notes pipeline as a <strong>mission-critical internal product</strong> rather than a collection of ad-hoc functions.",
    "singleWriter": "<strong>Centralized all database writes</strong> behind the pipeline, explicitly blocking direct ML access to prevent data corruption, race conditions, and side effects.",
    "telemetryObservability": "Required <strong>telemetry</strong> and <strong>observability</strong> mechanisms to ensure reliability at scale.",
    "temporal": "<strong>Selected Temporal</strong> as the workflow execution layer to enable deterministic, debuggable workflows with replay capability — trading short-term learning cost for long-term reliability and operability.",
