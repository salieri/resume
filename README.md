* Middleware and backend
* AI/LLM
* Frontend and user experience

## Architecture
* Scalable monorepo model
* Templates
  * NestJS
  * React
  * React-Router
  * React pacakge
  * NodeJS package

## Platform & Infrastructure

* TypeScript
* Featuring:
  * Responsive design for mobile and desktop
  * `@media print` styles for convenient printing
  * PDF generation
  * I18N and A11Y
  * Dark/light mode

## Code Quality
* Complex ESLint configuration
* Stylelint for CSS

## AI/ML/LLM
